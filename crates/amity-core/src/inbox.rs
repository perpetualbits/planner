//
// The Inbox is the conceptual foundation of Amity and the first promise the

//
// See docs/amity_brief.md §6.3 for the full data model.
// See docs/amity_philosophy.md for why "capture must be near-frictionless".
//
// This module is pure domain logic — no I/O, no async, no database types.
// All persistence is handled by `amity-storage::inbox`.

// Serde derives are used on all public types so they can be serialised to JSON
// for the API surface and stored as TEXT in the database.

// explicitly — "naive" datetimes are not used in this codebase (see brief §6.6).
