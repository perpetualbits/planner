# Family Organizer – Product Brief & MVP Plan

_Last updated: 2025‑10‑19_

## 0) Vision
Help families share the cognitive load of home life. Replace the kitchen chalkboard + paper calendars with a joyful, shared system that:
- Captures everything (events, chores, shopping, meals, maintenance, kids’ homework, clubs).
- Assigns responsibility fairly (breaks gendered defaults; supports rotation & load‑balancing).
- Surfaces the right thing at the right time (context‑aware nudges, glanceable UI).
- Works for everyone (kid‑friendly, non‑techy‑friendly, multilingual, neurodiversity‑aware).

Primary interface: a wall‑mounted touchscreen “hub” in the kitchen. Secondary: iOS/Android apps. Optional: voice listener in the kitchen.

---

## 1) Personas & Core Jobs-to-be-Done
**Care Coordinator (often mom today, but we aim to distribute):** wants visibility, delegation, and fewer mental checklists.
**Project/House Lead (often dad today):** wants planning views for projects, budgets, maintenance cycles.
**Teens/Kids:** want clear, bite‑sized tasks, streaks, and autonomy; privacy for personal items.
**All Adults:** want calendars unified, no duplicate entry, simple recurring workflows.

**JTBD Examples**
- “When the week starts, I need a menu plan and auto‑generated grocery list.”
- “When the bins are due, I want the right person reminded the night before.”
- “When a kid’s club fee is due, I want it surfaced alongside monthly budget.”
- “When homework is assigned, I want tiny check‑ins and parent sign‑off if needed.”

---

## 2) Scope for MVP (first 90 days)
**Must‑have**
1. **Kitchen Hub UI** with 4 tabs: _Today_, _Week_, _Meals_, _Lists_.
2. **Shared Task model** with owners, due, recurrence, difficulty, effort estimate, and rotation rules.
3. **Family Calendar** (read from Google/Apple/ICS) + write new family events.
4. **Meal Planner** (weekly board) → **Grocery List** by recipe/ingredient rules.
5. **Chores** with rotation (per day/week) + fairness/load‑balancing.
6. **Notifications**: push to phones; on‑hub chimes; optional LED light cue.
7. **Voice intents** (limited): “Add milk”, “What’s for dinner?”, “Who takes out bins?”
8. **Offline‑first data** (local hub) with cloud sync; read‑only mode without internet.

**Nice‑to‑have (stretch)**
- Simple homework tracking per child (subject, due, checklist, parent sign‑off).
- Maintenance planner (e.g., filters, gutters, boiler, bikes) with seasonal cadence.
- Budget hooks (tags per task/recipe; export to CSV).

---

## 3) Core Concepts & Data Model (draft)
**Entities**
- `FamilyMember { id, name, role, avatar, age, preferences, devices[] }`
- `Task { id, title, notes, ownerId?, assigneeIds[], dueAt, startAt?, duration?, priority, tags[], location?, effort(1‑5), difficulty(1‑5), status(enum), checklist[], recurrence(rule), rotation(rule), createdBy, createdAt, attachments[] }`
- `Event { id, title, startAt, endAt, allDay, attendees[], source(cal|local), location?, reminders[], visibility }`
- `Meal { id, day, slot(enum: breakfast/lunch/dinner), recipeId?, notes, servings }`
- `Recipe { id, title, ingredients[{name, qty, unit}], steps[], tags[], allergens[], cookTime, prepTime }`
- `List { id, type(enum: groceries/todo/packing), items[{id, text, qty?, unit?, checked, category}], autopopulateRules[] }`
- `RotationRule { id, type(enum: round‑robin/weighted), members[], cadence(enum), constraints (e.g., age >= 10), exceptions }`
- `MaintenanceItem { id, title, cadence(rule), lastDoneAt, responsibleRule, materials[], costEstimate }`
- `Homework { id, childId, subject, title, dueAt, subtasks[], requiresParentCheck(bool) }`

**Recurrence/Rotation Rule DSL (human‑readable)**
- Recurrence: `every=week; on=Mon`; `every=month; on=1st Sat`; `every=2 weeks; on=Thu`
- Rotation: `round_robin: [memberIds]; cadence=weekly; skipIfAway(true)`

**Fairness metric (alpha)**
- For each member: maintain rolling 28‑day _Effort Score_ = Σ(task.effort * completed) – Σ(debt)
- UI shows “Load Balance” bar + suggestions to reassign next rotation.

---

## 4) Interaction Model – Kitchen Hub
**Today Tab** (glanceable)
- Top row: current time, weather, next hard stop.
- “Now/Next” lane: current task/event cards per member (swipeable).
- Quick actions: +Task, +Event, +List item, +Meal note.
- Voice chip: “Say ‘Add milk’ or ‘What’s for dinner?’”.

**Week Tab**
- 7‑day columns with family rows (like your paper calendar). Drag‑drop tasks/events.
- Chore lane with rotation suggestions and fairness indicators.

**Meals Tab**
- Chalkboard‑style week menu; tap a slot to choose recipe; pantry check; generate grocery list.

**Lists Tab**
- Groceries grouped by store aisle; personal & shared lists; smart merge (no duplicates).

**Kid Mode**
- Large tiles; single “Today” list; streaks + small confetti moments; no ads, no distractions.

---

## 5) Mobile App (companion)
- Home: Today + notifications; quick capture (voice/text/camera for receipts/notes).
- Per‑member filter: “Show only my stuff” toggle.
- Offline capture: queue and auto‑sync.

---

## 6) Voice Intents (MVP)
- “Add [item] to groceries.” → List item.
- “What’s for dinner [day]?” → Meal card.
- “Who takes out the bins [this week]?” → Rotation answer.
- “Add event [title] on [day/time].” → Calendar entry.
- Wake phrase configurable; on‑device ASR preferred for privacy (Hotword + NLU).

---

## 7) Chore Rotation & Fairness (details)
- Configure eligible members, cadence, and exceptions (travel, exams, illness).
- Auto‑assignment proposes next assignee; one‑tap swap; logs reason.
- Fairness meter: shows rolling effort and “give a break” suggestion if someone’s overloaded.

**Edge cases**
- Missed chores roll forward with lower priority; avoid cascading guilt. Offer “skip w/ note.”

---

## 8) Meal → Groceries Pipeline
- Choose recipes per slot → ingredients merged → pantry subtract → store categories.
- Smart rules: “Always buy milk on Sunday”, “Double if guests ≥ 6”.
- Allergy/sensitivity flags per member → warnings on recipe selection.

---

## 9) Privacy, Safety & Roles
- Roles: Owner, Adult, Teen, Child, Guest.
- Visibility per item: Family / Adults / Private.
- Local‑first datastore on hub; E2E encryption for cloud sync.
- Voice redaction: wake‑phrase buffer only; no ambient recording.
- Data export/import (JSON/ICS/CSV). No lock‑in.

---

## 10) Integrations (phased)
- **Phase 1:** Google/Apple/ICS calendar read‑write; Reminders/Tasks import.
- **Phase 2:** Home Assistant (trash pickup schedule, presence, appliances), iCal garbage collection feeds.
- **Phase 3:** School portals (via email parsing / ICS); grocery delivery lists (export formats).

---

## 11) Hardware & Install
- **Hub options:**
  - Wall‑mounted Android tablet (budget) with kiosk app.
  - Raspberry Pi + 15.6\" touch display + 3D‑printed frame; PoE if possible.
- Always‑on with daylight dimming. Magnetic NFC tags for quick logins (kids tap badge).

---

## 12) Tech Stack (proposal)
- **Frontend:** React Native (mobile) + React (hub kiosk). Shared component library.
- **State:** Local IndexedDB/SQLite via RxDB or WatermelonDB; CRDTs for conflict‑free sync.
- **Backend:** Self‑hosted Go/Node service; WebSocket sync; optional cloud relay; Postgres.
- **Voice:** Local hotword (porcupine/snowboy alt), on‑device ASR where possible; fallback cloud.
- **Auth:** Passkeys + device‑scoped tokens; per‑member PIN/emoji lock for kid mode.

---

## 13) Success Metrics
- Weekly active family members ≥ 3.
- Reduction in “missed” critical tasks (bins, appointments) by ≥ 80% after 4 weeks.
- Close‑rate of assigned chores ≥ 85% with positive feedback.
- Self‑reported cognitive load reduction (survey) ≥ 30%.

---

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **Adoption friction:** Start with hub + minimal tabs; make capture 1‑tap/1‑sentence.
- **Privacy concerns:** Local‑first, minimal telemetry, clear export, no ads.
- **Over‑complexity:** Guardrails in UI; progressive disclosure; defaults tuned for families.

---

## 15) Roadmap (Quarter 1)
**Weeks 1–2**: clickable prototype for Hub (Today/Week/Meals/Lists). Usability test in family.
**Weeks 3–4**: implement Tasks, Meals, Lists; local storage; grocery merge rules.
**Weeks 5–6**: Calendar sync (Google/ICS); basic notifications; PoC voice intents.
**Weeks 7–8**: Chore rotation engine + fairness metric; Kid Mode v1.
**Weeks 9–10**: Offline‑first sync; conflict tests; data export.
**Weeks 11–12**: Polish, performance, accessibility; pilot in real‑world use.

---

## 16) Sample UX Copy & Screens
**Kitchen Hub / Meals (chalkboard style)**
```
Mon  Pasta pesto   |  Tue  Veggie chili  |  Wed  Stir-fry
Thu  Soup + bread  |  Fri  Pizza night   |  Sat  BBQ
Sun  Leftovers + salad
```
Buttons: [Generate Groceries] [Swap Meal] [Double Portions]

**Chore Rotation Card**
- _Bins this week:_ **Alex**  → [Swap] [Skip] [Done]
- _Dishwasher today:_ **Sam** → [Remind]

**Kid Mode “Today”**
- Big card: “Homework: Math worksheet (due Wed)” → [Start Timer 20m] [Done]
- Streak footer: 🔥 4‑day streak! High‑five!

---

## 17) Algorithms (brief)
**Fairness**: rolling window effort, with decay λ=0.9/week; suggest next assignee = argmin(expected_effort + fairness_penalty).
**Smart reminders**: bin night → remind 19:00 previous day; homework → micro‑nudge if 48h left & free window found.
**Pantry subtract**: maintain `PantryItem{name, qty, unit, lowThreshold}`; when item < threshold, auto‑add to list.

---

## 18) Open Questions (to iterate)
- Which calendars to sync first (Google vs Apple)?
- Do we need budgeting in MVP or just tags/CSV export?
- Do we support school homework portals initially, or manual entry only?
- What languages to support first (EN/NL)?

---

## 19) Definition of Done (MVP)
- A family of 3–6 can run an entire week from the Hub:
  - Menu planned, groceries generated and checked off on mobile.
  - Chores rotated fairly; notifications sent; 85% completion.
  - Calendar synced; at least 3 new events created via Hub/Voice.
  - All critical reminders fired on time (bins, meds, school forms).
- Data export validated; no fatal crash in a week; offline mode graceful.

---

## 20) Next Steps
1. Approve MVP scope above.
2. Choose hub hardware (tablet vs Pi) and mounting.
3. I’ll draft wireframes for the 4 tabs and voice micro‑flows.
4. Start a Git repo with schema stubs and a JSON export format.

## 21) Deep-Dive Discovery Questionnaire (answer succinctly; use bullets; mark unknowns)
### A. Mission, Scope, and Boundaries
1. **Primary mission**: If the system does only *three* things extraordinarily well, what are they?
   one: the system has moved the cognitive load of planning around family issues out of the primary care-givers heads, and they can trust the system to do this for them, or at least remind and assist when relevant.
   two: all basic things like chores and upkeep are planned and presented clearly and can be ticked off by users when they did them.
   three: The system can import and export calendars from schools, sportsclubs, garbage collection by the municipality (we have separate collection days for plastic, paper, organic and "rest")
3. **Non-goals**: What problems will we explicitly *not* solve in v1/v2 (e.g., budgeting, school portal scraping)? Why?
   Budgetting and school portal scraping is too complex for now and requires too much coupling with external systems that require possible non-standard ways of scraping. Importing ICS files would be standard, but automatically getting homework from systems meant for students is a bit too complex for now.
4. **Failure posture**: In what scenarios is it acceptable for the system to *do nothing* rather than risk wrong output?
   Anything that the system is not configured for doing.
### B. Family Model & Consent
4. **Household graph**: Who counts as a member (live-in, co-parent across homes, grandparents, au pairs, roommates)?
   People living in the same house who should share the work, co-parents partly (for instance coordinating buying clothes, schoolsupplies, medicine, and so on), a cleaning lady who should see the cleaning schedule but not the kids homework, au pairs should see the kids homework, roommates count as full members of the house.
6. **Consent model**: What can adults see from teens? From children? Are there “sealed” items even owners can’t open?
   Adults can see what teens are willing to share. Children still have some say in this, but less so.
7. **Shared custody**: How do we represent alternating‑weeks schedules and cross‑house data sharing?
   House-related things do not need to be shared, but issues about children or other dependants who fall under shared custody need to be shared. Time that people are not present (children at other parent's house, parent who works 6 weeks offshore and is home 6 weeks) needs to be masked for house chores and other planning concerning the house.
8. **Guest access**: Temporary codes? NFC tap badges? Time‑boxed permissions?
   Temporary login with timed auto-logout.

### C. Fairness, Load & Motivation
8. **Fairness metric**: How do *you* define fair? (time spent, effort, unpleasantness, reliability, skill growth)
   The system is not meant as a replacement for people working out what is fair. That would be a mistake to even try. Experiencing unpleasantness is a subjective and personal thing, differs per person. The system should give insight in time taken to do tasks, if people are willing to enter start and end times for chores. But even without that, just listing who did what per day or week is insightful, and shows the load distribution. Ideally, the system should just present all work that needs to be done, and people should negotiate their share in an amenable manner.
9. **Rotation rules**: What constraints exist (age ≥ X, allergies, strength, school nights, religious days)?
  If time periods are not available for members to work (other duties, holy days), the calendar should just block those, and people should still negotiate the work among themselves. Again, the system is not meant as a work distributor, but as a planner.
10. **Negotiation**: How do members propose swaps/deferments without shaming? (reasons, limits, cooldowns)
   If a task is done, the person who completed it should enter that in the system. If it is not entered as completed, it should simply be marked as such. The system is not meant to mediate or negotiate. It is meant to make organising easy and remove headache, not to replace inter-human dynamics.
11. **Motivation style**: Points/badges/streaks vs. intrinsic celebrations? Family rewards vs. individual?
   This is not a goal for this system. It should just provide clarity of what work is done, and yes it is clear who did what. Beyond that, artificial rewards by a program such as smileys are not wanted. People reward people, if only by having peace of mind and harmony.

### D. Calendars & Time Semantics
12. **Authoritative calendars**: Google, Apple, Outlook, school ICS, sports teams? Who can write back?
13. **Time zones & travel**: How do events shift when a parent travels? “Home time” vs “local time” views?
14. **Recurrence edges**: Bin day on holidays, daylight savings jumps, 5th‑week anomalies—what are your expectations?

### E. Chores & Home Maintenance
15. **Chore taxonomy**: Daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal; indoor/outdoor; maintenance vs. tidying.
16. **Seasonality**: Garden tasks (Netherlands climate), gutters, boiler, bikes—what cadences?
17. **Supplies coupling**: Which chores imply automatic list items (bin bags, dishwasher salt, chicken feed)?

### F. Meals → Groceries → Pantry
18. **Meal planning style**: fixed weekly plan vs. rolling two‑week? Breakfast/lunch tracked or just dinner?
19. **Dietary rules**: Allergies, vegetarian days, halal/kosher, low‑carb, athlete macros—how strict?
20. **Grocery flows**: Multiple stores/markets? Substitutions? Minimum pantry levels? Bulk buying cadence?
21. **Waste minimization**: Leftover planning, “use‑first” list, expiry tracking—how proactive?

### G. Children & Homework
22. **Homework capture**: Manual entry vs. scrape email/portal vs. photo‑OCR of assignments?
23. **Parent involvement**: Approvals, timers (Pomodoro), reading logs, device‑free time prompts?
24. **Privacy**: Can a teen mark an item private? Can adults override? Under what policy?

### H. Notifications & Attention
25. **Notification budget**: Max N per day? Priority levels? Quiet hours per member? Home vs. away modes?
26. **Escalation**: If a critical item isn’t acknowledged, who gets pinged next and how (push, chime, light strip)?
27. **Glanceables**: What must be visible *at a glance* on the hub at all times?

### I. Voice & Kiosk UX
28. **Wake words**: Custom phrase? Physical mute? LED status? On‑device hotword required?
29. **Voice intents** (MVP list): Which 10 utterances matter most? (add item, who has bins, what’s for dinner…)
30. **Accessibility**: Large touch targets, dyslexia‑friendly fonts, color‑blind safe palette, Dutch/English support.

### J. Integrations & Automations
31. **Home Assistant**: Presence, trash schedule, washer/dryer done, doorbell events?
32. **Email parsing**: From which senders (school, clubs) should we extract dates/fees?
33. **Location signals**: Geofences (arrive near store → show list), commute calendars, weather‑based reschedules.

### K. Privacy, Security & Legal
34. **Data locality**: Must data stay on‑prem? Is cloud relay allowed? End‑to‑end encryption?
35. **Right to be forgotten**: How do we purge a child’s data upon request? Audit log retention policy?
36. **Abuse prevention**: Protections against surveillance or coercive control (e.g., hidden‑mode resources)?

### L. Governance & Admin
37. **Admins**: Who can create members, reset PINs, change privacy defaults, export data?
38. **Conflict logging**: Do we keep mediated negotiation records for transparency? For how long?
39. **House split/merge**: Family dissolves or merges—how do we migrate portions of data cleanly?

### M. Metrics & Success
40. **KPIs**: What will prove cognitive‑load reduction? (missed tasks ↓, mom’s mental checklist ↓, NPS ↑)
41. **Feedback loop**: In‑product micro‑surveys? Weekly “How did this week feel?” check‑ins?

### N. Internationalization
42. **Languages**: EN/NL at launch? Date formats, school holiday calendars, garbage pickup ICS by municipality?

### O. Hardware & Install
43. **Hub choice**: Tablet vs. Pi + display; PoE; wall‑mount constraints; always‑on power management.
44. **Auth at hub**: Per‑member quick switch (NFC/QR/PIN/emoji). Auto‑switch via face‑recognition or presence?

## 23) Master Prompt Template (to drive future design sprints)
> Copy this into ChatGPT and fill the bracketed fields.

**System / Context**
You are a product, UX, and family‑systems design partner. We are designing a local‑first family organizer with a kitchen hub, mobile apps, and limited on‑device voice. Privacy and fairness are first‑class.

**Key Inputs**
- Household profile: [members, ages, roles, custody rules]
- Privacy policy: [visibility matrix from §22.1]
- Fairness settings: [weights, window, constraints]
- Notification policy: [quiet hours, escalation, budgets]
- Meal/grocery policy: [dietary rules, stores, pantry rules]
- Integrations: [calendars, Home Assistant, email senders]
- Hardware: [hub device, mount, auth method]
- Languages: [EN/NL]
- Non‑goals: [list]

**Tasks for the model**
1. Propose weekly flows for Today/Week/Meals/Lists aligned to inputs.
2. Generate voice intent grammar (top 10) + error‑recovery dialogs.
3. Draft chore rotation algorithm config + 3 conflict scenarios with resolutions.
4. Produce push/alert schedule for a sample week under budget.
5. Output data schemas for Tasks/Events/Meals/Lists with privacy fields.
6. List risky edge cases and mitigations.

**Output Format**
- Sectioned Markdown with tables and bullet points. No code unless requested.

---

## 24) Edge Cases & Social Dynamics (challenge set)
- One parent disables notifications; how do we still ensure bins go out?
- Teen opts into privacy; a school trip fee is due—who gets told and how?
- Power outage / no internet weekend—what remains functional on the hub?
- Dishwasher chore undone 3×; fairness shows imbalance—what auto‑proposal appears?
- Guests staying 10 days—how do tasks and meals adapt temporarily?

---

## 25) Validation Plan Before Any Coding
1. **Paper prototypes** of the four tabs with your family; observe for 3 evenings.
2. **Cognitive walkthrough** using 5 scripted tasks (add milk, swap bins, plan dinner, log homework, add event).
3. **Policy simulation**: Run 2 weeks in a spreadsheet for rotation + notifications; measure conflict/resolution frequency.
4. **Privacy drill**: Try to access a teen’s private item from admin; verify policy outcomes.
5. **Data export rehearsal**: Populate sample data and perform full export → check for GDPR basics.

---

## 26) Open Assumptions to Test
- Load‑balancing improves perceived fairness more than gamified points.
- Local‑first with cloud relay meets convenience *and* privacy needs.
- Limited voice (10 intents) covers 80% of real kitchen commands.
- Glanceable hub reduces mental checklists by ≥30%.
